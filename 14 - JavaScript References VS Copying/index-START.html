    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
  const team=players;
  console.log(players,team);

  const team3=players.slice();

   const team2=[...players];
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // const captain=person;
    // captain.number=90;
    const captain2=Object.assign({},person,{number:99});
    console.log(captain2);

    // const cap3={...person};
    const wes={
      name:'wes',
      age:'20',
      social:
      {
        twitter:'@wesbos'
      }
    }
console.clear();
console.log(wes);

const dev=Object.assign({},wes);

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
